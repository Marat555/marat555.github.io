They say that the right music allows to catch the flow and improve the concentration and performance during the task.

In my case, it depends on the task Iâ€™m doing and my state of mind. For complex algorithms I need silence. Even the most ambient music can disturb my thoughts, so I just stop any music that is playing and focus on the task.
For chores and simple tasks, I like to keep my music player playing lofi hip hop.

So I put together my favorite lofi beats in the Spotify to enjoy while coding playlist.

I'm sure you will like it too.
